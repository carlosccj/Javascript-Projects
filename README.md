Little Javascriot projects with no particular focus I'm working on

The Counter, Blackjack, Memory Game, Guac-a-Mole and Rock-Paper-Sccissors are just beginner projects to learn the Javascriot syntax.

Breakout is a little more complex project I've yet not finished.

Shadowrun pretends to be a TTRPG automatic character creator and is also on development.
